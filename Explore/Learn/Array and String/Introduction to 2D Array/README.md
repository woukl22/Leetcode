```
In the previous chapter, we have learned about the one-dimensional array.
However, sometimes, we might need a multidimensional array which is more
suitable for more complex structures like table or matrix.

In this chapter, we are going to focus on the two-dimensional array to explain:

How does a multidimensional array work?
How to use a two-dimensional array to solve problems?

Summary

### Introduction to 2D Array
Two-dimensional array also consists of sequence of elements.<br>
But the elements can be laid out in a rectangular grid rather than a line.<br>

- C++: Stores the two-dimensional array as a one-dimensional array.
- Java: The two-dimensional array is actually a one-dimensional array which contains M elements, each of which is an array of N integers.
### Dynamic 2D Array
This is equal as a nested dynamic array.

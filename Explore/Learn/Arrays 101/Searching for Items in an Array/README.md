Arrays 101 - Searching for Items in an Array

<br>

Summary
----
In this explore, we are going to learn two simple searching operation.<br>
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search

<br>

### Linear Search
Linear search is check every element until we find element we looking for.<br>
In worst case, it will check all the element in Array. So time complexity is ```O(N)```.<br>

<br>

### Binary Search
Binary search can be use when all the elements in Array are in sorted order.<br>
We check middle element, and find whether element we are looking for is in left or right.<br>
If we go to one way(ex: left), and if we didn't find element, then check middle of left side elements again.<br><br>
Binary search is faster than linear search.<br>
*(I will learn binary search in ```Binary Search Explore Card``` later.)*
